##A M100 oriented groundstation

http://dji-brainhole.github.io/groundmelon

How to use:

* left mouse for rotation
* right mouse to translate
* wheel to zoom in/out the view
* CTRL+wheel to zoom in/out the map
* waypoint is dragable, with its shadow followed on the ground 

(the loading is quite lag when hold on Github Pages, it's better to download and run on localhost)

* powered by three.js.
* provide websocket communicator
* will be integrated into M100 QT sample
* however, sadly, a 2D map, that's too bad
* deprecated, no more contribution to it from the Brainhole team, unless there happened any QT compatibility issue(s)
